A hotel management system was characterized as a system that allows a hotel or group of hotels to handle front-office functions such as booking reservations,
guest check-in/checkout, room assignment, controlling room prices, and billing.The fundamental goal of this hotel management system is to deliver exceptional 
customer service and assure client happiness.The hotel management project includes room booking, personnel management, and other hotel management functions.
The technology allows the management to list available rooms in the system. Customers may see and reserve rooms online. Admin has the authority to approve or
reject the customer's booking request. Customers may also see and book other hotel services. As a result, the system may be used by both consumers and management 
to control hotel activities on the go. The application was programmed with the JavaScript, PHP, and Blade programming languages, with Visual Studio Code as the
development IDE and a Firebase database for the storage of data.
